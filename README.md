# Sand Simulator

## About the Project

The Sand Simulator is a computational simulation based on cellular automata principles. It models the behavior of sand particles in a virtual environment using simple, yet effective, rules.

## Features

- Simulation of sand particles in a virtual environment using cellular automata rules.
- Implementation of basic sand behavior rules:
  - Sand particles fall down if the space below is empty.
  - Sand particles spread to the left or right if the spaces below are occupied but adjacent spaces are empty.
- Simple and intuitive interface using HTML and Vanilla JavaScript.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Start a local server, for example, using Live Server.
3. Access `/index.html` on the server.
